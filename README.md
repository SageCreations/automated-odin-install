# automated-odin-install
A python script that automates the Odin programming language's install process.


## The odin repo will get cloned in the same directory as the one you run the script from.

### TODO:
- need to do the windows setup
- Test the linux version and add checks
- Update macos setup with automated brew install if brew does not exist on user's system.
- more things as I come across issues while testing.
